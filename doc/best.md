# Best of the cats

The goal of this documentation is providing godfat's own opinion regarding
which cats are the best amongst each areas. It does not limit to just Ubers,
and it will not cover all cats because we only want to use cats which are
good at the area we're looking at.

The evaluation will be ranked at:

* Best
* Great
* Good

Anything below good will not be mentioned at all. Rationale for such
evaluation will be provided.

Feedbacks are welcome via any channel you can reach me (godfat).

## Anti-traitless

* Best, (Uber) [Valiant D'arktanyan](https://battle-cats.fandom.com/wiki/D'arktanyan_(Uber_Rare_Cat)):
  Their DPS is less than Diabolic Gao when not strengthen, but when strengthen
  under 60%, the DPS is much higher than Diabolic Gao, and they're only
  slightly less tanky than Diabolic Gao, having much cheaper price and much
  lower cooldown, rush fast, attack fast and damage lands on range 200 ~ 550,
  what more we can expect?

* Great, (Uber) [Diabolic Gao](https://battle-cats.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Gao_(Uber_Rare_Cat)):
  While they're not as impressive as Valiant D'arktanyan, still crazy DPS and
  can stand far at range 480, making them the best cat to beat
  Manic Eraser Cat and Mystic Mask Yulala (Heavenly Tower floor 40), which
  Valiant D'arktanyan can't. If you want to pass them with ease, they're the
  best at that.

* Great, (Uber) [Gothic Mitama](https://battle-cats.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Mitama_(Uber_Rare_Cat)):
  The ultimate control for traitless, just like Mitama the Oracle is the
  ultimate control for traited enemies. However, we usually don't have to
  control the traitless if we can destroy them quickly, just like what
  Valiant D'arktanyan can do. So in the end we don't usually need
  Gothic Mitama that much when we already have Valiant D'arktanyan.
  One of the stages they shine a lot is No Return Flights, where there are
  so many powerful traitless enemies.

* Good, (Rare) [Teacher BearCat](https://battle-cats.fandom.com/wiki/Teacher_BearCat_(Rare_Cat)):
  Very powerful DPS. The range is too short to be too useful in most stages,
  but whenever they can hit, they kill traitless quickly.

* Good, (Rare) [Supercat](https://battle-cats.fandom.com/wiki/Mightycat_(Rare_Cat)):
  Very tanky with a lot of knockback, adding that they can weaken traitless
  means they can tank so long against traitless enemies with very low cost.
  Very useful in a lot of early stages to accumulate money.
