<ol>
  <li>Pick a gacha event (e.g. <em>Ultra Souls</em> or <em>Uberfest</em>). Use your rare (gold) tickets or cat food. Both work the same.</li>
  <li>Roll several times. Preferably 7 to 10 rolls. Record the results. The more rolls you made, the more accurate the result will be.</li>
  <li>Fill the results at seed seeking</a> in the respective rolling order. Make sure you pick the gacha event you rolled with.</li>
  <li>
    If you made a 11-rolls with a guaranteed event, or a 15-rolls (3+5+7) with step-up event:
    <ol>
      <li><strong><em>Don't fill</em> your last <a href="#what-is-a-guaranteed-uber">guaranteed uber</a> in the form.</strong></li>
      <li>Fill the last 10 rolls without the last guaranteed uber.</li>
      <li>We'll need to accommodate this when reading your result because you <em>didn't fill</em> the last roll in the form. We need to count the offset. More on this below.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>Avoid gacha events</em> having duplicated cats (e.g. <em>Metal Busters</em> or <em>Best of the Best</em>). If you did, you'll need to trial and error to find the correct one, because we can't tell which one you actually rolled. You can only try them one by one.</li>
</ol>
